## Project Summary

CourseOverflow is a centralized platform for all CS questions for UIUC courses. 

The goal of our application is for university students to be able to easily access questions for courses they have previously taken, or courses they have not taken but want to learn more about. Our project will be built on an existing StackOverflow dataset to create test functionality and a new database will be linked to the project websiteâ€“ this database will be populated with questions specific to selected UIUC Computer Science courses. Our new database will allow the creation of a singular platform for students to access relevant questions that have previously been asked for the selected courses. This is a classroom-specific feature for our application, but it can be utilized in other industries as a secondary source of Computer Science-related FAQ.


Our project aims at eventually centralizing all the current platforms that students use for asking questions about their courses, such as Piazza, Ed, and Campuswire. This will help students easily access solutions to their questions, and decrease the workload on professors and course assistants.
